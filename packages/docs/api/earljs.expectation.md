```

## Constructors

|  Constructor | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [(constructor)(actual, isNegated, options)](./earljs.expectation._constructor_.md) |  | Constructs a new instance of the <code>Expectation</code> class |

## Properties

|  Property | Modifiers | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  [not](./earljs.expectation.not.md) |  | [Expectation](./earljs.expectation.md)<!-- -->&lt;T&gt; | Inverts the behaviour of the validator that follows. |

## Methods

|  Method | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [toBeA(this, clazz)](./earljs.expectation.tobea.md) |  | Checks if the value is an instance of the provided class or primitive type. Examples:<!-- -->1. <code>expect(object).toBeA(MyClass)</code> - checks if object is instance of <code>MyClass</code>, but not <code>Other</code> 2. <code>expect(foo).toBeA(String)</code> - checks if foo is instance of string |
|  [toBeAContainerWith(this, expectedItems)](./earljs.expectation.tobeacontainerwith.md) |  | Checks if the value is an iterable containing all of the provided items. |
|  [toBeAnArrayOfLength(this, length)](./earljs.expectation.tobeanarrayoflength.md) |  | Checks if the values is an array containing exactly given number of items. |
|  [toBeAnArrayWith(this, expectedItems)](./earljs.expectation.tobeanarraywith.md) |  | Checks if the value is an array containing all of the provided items. |
|  [toBeAnObjectWith(this, subset)](./earljs.expectation.tobeanobjectwith.md) |  | Checks if the value is an object containing given key-value pairs. |
|  [toBeExhausted(this)](./earljs.expectation.tobeexhausted.md) |  | Checks if all the expected calls to the mock have been performed. |
|  [toBeGreaterThan(this, target)](./earljs.expectation.tobegreaterthan.md) |  | Checks if the value is greater than the provided target. |
|  [toBeGreaterThanOrEqualTo(this, target)](./earljs.expectation.tobegreaterthanorequalto.md) |  | Checks if the value is greater than or equal to the provided target. |
|  [toBeLessThan(this, target)](./earljs.expectation.tobelessthan.md) |  | Checks if the value is less than the provided target. |
|  [toBeLessThanOrEqualTo(this, target)](./earljs.expectation.tobelessthanorequalto.md) |  | Checks if the value is less than or equal the provided target. |
|  [toBeRejected(this)](./earljs.expectation.toberejected.md) |  | Awaits the provided promise and expects it to be rejected. |
|  [toBeRejected(this, message)](./earljs.expectation.toberejected_1.md) |  | Awaits the provided promise and expects it to be rejected. The message of the error is also checked. |
|  [toBeRejected(this, errorClass, message)](./earljs.expectation.toberejected_2.md) |  | Awaits the provided promise and expects it to be rejected. The error's class and message are also checked. |
|  [toEqual(value)](./earljs.expectation.toequal.md) |  | Performs a recursive equality check. Objects are equal if their fields are equal and they share the same prototype.<!-- -->You can use matchers in place of a value. When a matcher is encountered its internal rules are used instead of the usual checks. |
|  [toHaveBeenCalledExactlyWith(this, args)](./earljs.expectation.tohavebeencalledexactlywith.md) |  | Checks the entire history of mock calls.<!-- -->You can use matchers in place of a value. When a matcher is encountered its internal rules are used instead of the usual checks. |
|  [toHaveBeenCalledWith(this, args)](./earljs.expectation.tohavebeencalledwith.md) |  | Check if the mock has been called with the provided arguments.<!-- -->You can use matchers in place of a value. When a matcher is encountered its internal rules are used instead of the usual checks. |
|  [toLooseEqual(value)](./earljs.expectation.tolooseequal.md) |  | Performs a recursive equality check. Objects are equal if their fields are equal. Object prototypes are ignored.<!-- -->You can use matchers in place of a value. When a matcher is encountered its internal rules are used instead of the usual checks. |
|  [toMatchSnapshot(this)](./earljs.expectation.tomatchsnapshot.md) |  | Checks that the value is the same as in the previous test execution. |
|  [toReferentiallyEqual(this, value)](./earljs.expectation.toreferentiallyequal.md) |  | Performs a referential equality check using <code>Object.is</code>. It is similar to <code>===</code>, with two differences:<!-- -->1. <code>Object.is(-0, +0)</code> returns <code>false</code> 2. <code>Object.is(NaN, NaN)</code> returns <code>true</code>This function should be used if you care about object identity rather than deep equality. |
|  [toThrow(this)](./earljs.expectation.tothrow.md) |  | Calls the provided function and expects an error to be thrown. |
|  [toThrow(this, message)](./earljs.expectation.tothrow_1.md) |  | Calls the provided function and expects an error to be thrown. The message of the error is also checked. |
|  [toThrow(this, errorClass, message)](./earljs.expectation.tothrow_2.md) |  | Calls the provided function and expects an error to be thrown. The error's class and message are also checked. |
